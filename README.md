# S&P500 Visualization
Final project for a graduate "Data Visualization" course at Ukrainian Catholic University

The project consists of three pretty visualizations of S&P 500 stocks performance made with plotly.

Unfortunately, generated HTML files are too large and can't be displayed in GitHub, so I suggest taking a look at them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1byKnXyYHxiGPuANmvu_k0Td7s2MeNzZO?usp=sharing) or download the project and open the figures locally in your browser.
