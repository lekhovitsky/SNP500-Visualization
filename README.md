# S&P 500 Visualization
Final project for a graduate "Data Visualization" course at Ukrainian Catholic University.

The project consists of three pretty visualizations of S&P 500 stocks performance made with `plotly`.

GitHub doesn't allow rendering large HTML files, so you can take a look at the results at these links:
* [Figure 1: Stock-vs-Sector-vs-Market performance](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lekhovitsky/SNP500-Visualization/blob/master/figures/fig1.html)
* [Figure 2: Top winners/losers of 2019](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lekhovitsky/SNP500-Visualization/blob/master/figures/fig2.html)
* [Figure 3: Monthly/quarterly sectors performance](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lekhovitsky/SNP500-Visualization/blob/master/figures/fig3.html)

Alternatively, you can take a look at them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1byKnXyYHxiGPuANmvu_k0Td7s2MeNzZO?usp=sharing).
