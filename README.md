# S&P 500 Visualization
Final project for a graduate "Data Visualization" course at Ukrainian Catholic University.

The project consists of three pretty visualizations of S&P 500 stocks performance made with plotly.

GitHub doesn't allow rendering large HTML files, so you can take a look at the results at these links:
* [Figure 1](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lekhovitsky/SNP500-Visualization/blob/master/figures/fig1.html)
* [Figure 2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lekhovitsky/SNP500-Visualization/blob/master/figures/fig2.html)
* [Figure 3](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lekhovitsky/SNP500-Visualization/blob/master/figures/fig3.html)
